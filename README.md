# StudentSkillEvaluator.java
built a Java console-based application that allows evaluation of a studentâ€™s performance based on input scores across multiple skill areas. The program will calculate averages, assign grades, and provide a basic performance analysis. This project strengthens understanding of arrays, input/output, conditionals, and modular programming.
